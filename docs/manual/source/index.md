Hi-Five is a minimal BDD test runner that's designed to stay out of your way
and just let you do your testing. It plays along with Browserify, and can be
easily integrated with any CI (that can run JavaScript).


  - **Not-A-Framework**: Hi-five should let you, the programmer, lead the way
    and define how testing should be done. Bring your own reporters & assertion
    libraries.

  - **Run anywhere**: Hi-five should run in any JS VM that supports at least
    the ECMAScript 3 specification.

  - **Easy to integrate**: Hi-five should be easy to integrate with any CI or
    other system.

  - **Support async**: Hi-five should support asynchronous tests as
    first-class.
