Hi-Five
=======

Hi-Five is a minimal BDD test runner thatâ€™s designed to stay out of your way
and just let you do your testing. It plays along with Browserify, and can be
easily integrated with any CI (that can run JavaScript).

Not-A-Framework
    Hi-Five should let you, the programmer, lead the way and define how testing
    should be done. Bring your own reporters & assertion libraries.

Run anywhere
    Hi-Five should run in any JS VM that supports at least the ECMAScript 3
    specification.

Easy to integrate
    Hi-Five should be easy to integrate with any CI or other system.

Support async
    Hi-Five should support asynchronous tests as first-class.
