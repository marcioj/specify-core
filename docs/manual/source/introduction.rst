Introduction
============

This documentation will guide you through all the concepts in the Hi-Five
library. Hi-Five is a minimal BDD test runner designed to stay out of your way
and just let you do your testing, as well as easily integrate with any other
JavaScript system/platform.


Why use Hi-Five?
----------------

Since JavaScript isn't a particularly well suited language for guaranteeing the
quality of programs written in it, programmers need to rely on external
analysis and assurance tools for that. One particularly well used tool is
automatic testing.

Hi-Five provides a library designed towards the Behaviour-Driven Development
methodology to software testing, that can fit any environment and
work-flow. This is done by making the whole framework completely modular, such
that you can pick and match the features you're interested in, and use each
library independently in any context.

The framework follows this philosophy:

Not-A-Framework
    Hi-Five should let you, the programmer, lead the way and define how testing
    should be done. Bring your own reporters & assertion libraries.

Run anywhere
    Hi-Five should run in any JS VM that supports at least the ECMAScript 3
    specification.

Easy to integrate
    Hi-Five should be easy to integrate with any CI or other system.

Support async
    Hi-Five should support asynchronous tests as first-class.
