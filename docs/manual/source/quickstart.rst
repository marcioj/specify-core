===============

Prerequisites
-------------

This page will guide you through all the things you need to do to start writing
tests with Hi-Five on Node, and Browsers (the instructions should be similar to
other platforms). It assumes that you'll be using Sweet.js macros for writing
the tests, as well as the `alright`_ assertion library.
